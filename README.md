# Hyperskill-Matrices
This is an implementation of one of the [hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org/) projects.
It is an interactive console app that does some operations on matrices.

## An example of the application

```
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix to a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
Your choice: > 6
Enter matrix size: > 3 3
Enter matrix:
> 2 -1 0
> 0 1 2
> 1 1 0
The result is:
 0.33   0  0.33
-0.33   0  0.66
 0.16 0.5 -0.33
